A vulnerable contract game,try to beat the variant cat - the boss of cat to get flag

To solve this challenge,you need to:
1.get a metamask count
2.get some rinkeby test coin (rinkeby is a test network of eos)
3.know some basic usage of metamask and solidity
4.if you want to make all the process automatically,you can learn web3.py or web3.js

Here is an online ide for solidity: https://remix.ethereum.org which can connect to main/rinkeby/ropsten/kovan/others eos network.
When you had solved it,submit base64(YOUR_EMAIL) to function `getFlag()`.
